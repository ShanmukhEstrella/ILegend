HTTP URL: 127.0.0.1:{{port_number}}/api/data/insertrow

  This end point takes the input for inserting a row in the table

   For example:
   Input in ILegend Notebook:
   [id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 25, isActive: true] -> warehouse1::db1::schema1::table1
   
  Payload sent to the API:
  {
    "path": "warehouse1::db1::schema1::table1",
    "row": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice"
        "age": 25,
        "isActive": true
    }
}

Note: 1) The table should be first existing to insert a row into it. (Else we made sure to raise an error)
      2) The attribute type should match with the type of the element we are adding. (Else we made sure to raise an error)
      3) We can't add two rows with the same element in it's primary key field. (Else we made sure to raise an error)

  Output in ILegend Notebook:
  {
  "message": "Row added",
  "row": {
    "id": 1,
     "name": "Alice",
     "age": 25,
     "isActive": true,
  }
}
